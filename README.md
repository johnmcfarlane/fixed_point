This project contains a reference implementation of a binary fixed-point arithmetic library
put forward as an addition to the ISO C++ Standard in paper, [P0037](http://johnmcfarlane.github.io/fixed_point/p0037.html).
It is developed as part of study groups, [SG14](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!forum/sg14) and SG6.

Some [instructions are provided](http://johnmcfarlane.github.io/fixed_point/) for anyone wishing to learn more or use the library.
All feedback via [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/fixed_point)
or the [SG14 forum](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!forum/sg14) is welcome.
